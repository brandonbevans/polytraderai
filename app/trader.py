    Market:
    {str(market)}

    Recommendation:
    Selected Outcome: {market.outcomes[recommendation.outcome_index]}
    Conviction: {recommendation.conviction}/100
    Reasoning: {recommendation.reasoning}

    ACCOUNT STATUS:
    Available USDC Balance: {balances["USDC"]:.2f}

    Your task is to create an order that:
    1. POSITION SIZING:
    - Base Position Size on both conviction and available USDC balance
    - For high conviction (>80): Use up to 25% of available USDC balance
    - For medium conviction (60-80): Use up to 15% of available USDC balance
    - For lower conviction (<60): No trade
    - Never exceed $1000 per trade regardless of conviction
    - Remember: Total USDC spent = size * price
    - Position Size needs to be at least $5

    2. TOKEN SELECTION:
    - Use token_id: {market.clob_token_ids[recommendation.outcome_index]}
    - This corresponds to the recommended outcome: {market.outcomes[recommendation.outcome_index]}

    3. PRICE EXECUTION:
    - Current market price is: {market.outcome_prices[recommendation.outcome_index]:.4f}
    - Set limit price 0.5% above current highest bid to ensure execution while minimizing slippage
    - This places us at top of order book but better than market order price
    - Example: If current price is 0.4000, set limit at ~0.4020


    RISK MANAGEMENT RULES:
    - Never risk more than 25% of available balance on a single trade
    - Ensure minimum order size is respected (minimum $5)
    - Account for price impact on larger orders
    - Leave some balance for future opportunities

    Output a OrderDetails object with these exact fields:
    - order_args: OrderArgs object with the correct token ID and position size
    OrderArgs:
        - price: The current market price for the outcome
        - size: The amount of shares to buy at the above price
        - side: "BUY"
        - token_id: The correct token ID for the chosen outcome
    
    Note: The product of size and price MUST be at least $1
